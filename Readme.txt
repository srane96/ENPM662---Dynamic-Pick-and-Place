To run the simulation, follow the steps given below:

1. Open matlab-vrep.ttt in VREP software.
2. Click Run button to activate VREP.
3. Then open IRB-Kinematics-Finals.mlx and 'run each section separately'. 
Poisition of the joint 5 is the target position given in the documentation of the IRB 140.
4. Hence, while simulation is running, you can click on the joint5 to see it's position for the given
angles.
